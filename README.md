1) This file explains how to use the provided programs.

2) Each task corresponds to a Python file [which will be called here task or file] named Task##.py where ## stands for the number of the task.

3) Some tasks import from other files. Please make sure that you change the adress in the files that do so.

4) The tasks that import from other tasks are: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14.

5) Additionaly to importation between files of the project, the project uses the following Python modules: numpy, random, math, sys, matplotlib and pulp.

6) You can run each Python file alone provided that the importation is well-done.

7) For tests, you can call the test functions. In order to identify them, we used the following nomenclature: testN1_N2_N3. N1 is the number of the task. N2 is the number of the instance. N3 is the number of the tested task. N3 is only used for Task 4.
