    "Nowadays, the subject of ressorce allocation is more and more present in the public scene since social justice advocates ask for the inclusion of affirmative action criteria in the schools selection process. In this project, we will see how to implement some of these criteria such as quotas and the $\\frac{4}{5}$-rule. During this phase, we will try to ensure that the matching is *stable*, i.e. feasible, individually rational, fair and non-wasteful.\n",
